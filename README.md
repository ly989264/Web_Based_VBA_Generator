# Web_Based_VBA_Generator

### A simple web application written with Flask.

The motivations or purposes of writing some VBA scripts are always similar -- searching certain characters in certain columns over rows in some worksheets and employing some operations like copy and paste. But writing this kind of VBA scripts can be repetitive and boring -- similar codes and mostly translation from Excel worksheets to VBA statements. This web application can be used to simplify this process by inputting the requirements in a web page and automatically generating VBA scripts on the fly.

### Usage:
```
python3 app.py
```
